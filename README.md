Hi guys! My name is Zebenai Melaku, and I’m a third-year Computer Engineering student. Welcome to my portfolio! I created this website from scratch using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a few other tools I’ve been learning along the way.

This space is where I get to share some of the projects I’ve worked on, the skills I’ve been building, and the things that inspire me in tech and design. I love exploring how people interact with technology, and I want this site to reflect that curiosity and creativity.

Thanks for taking the time to stop by—feel free to explore, click around, and get to know my work. I’m excited to share my journey with you!
